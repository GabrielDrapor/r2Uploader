# Active Context: R2Uploader

## Current Focus
Initial setup and understanding of the project based on the README.

## Recent Changes
- Memory bank initialized.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `progress.md`) populated based on `README.md` analysis.

## Next Steps
1. Populate `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` by analyzing the codebase (e.g., `package.json`, main application files).
2. Refine memory bank content based on code analysis and further user input.
3. Address items from the project roadmap (Filter by created time, Automatic download of small objects).

## Active Decisions/Considerations
- Need to identify the primary technologies and architectural patterns used in the project.
- Need to determine the main entry point(s) of the application code.

## Important Patterns/Preferences
- Emphasis on user-friendly UI/UX for non-technical users.
- Use of visual elements like Masonry layout.
- Contextual actions via right-click.

## Learnings/Insights
- The project is already quite mature, with existing releases and a defined feature set.
- The README provides a good overview but lacks technical implementation details.
