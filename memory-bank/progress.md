# Progress: R2Uploader

## Current Status
Application exists and is available for download on macOS (ARM64, Intel) and Windows. Core functionality seems implemented based on README features.

## What Works (Based on README)
- Core connection to Cloudflare R2 (Account ID, API Token).
- Object browsing (Masonry layout).
- "Super Right-Click" for object management (export, delete, copy link, copy to clipboard).
- Prefix-based search.
- Folder navigation (delimiter support).
- Smart uploads (overwrite prevention with rename option).
- Custom domain integration.
- Image export and copy.
- Automatic updates.
- Licensing mechanism (via Lemon Squeezy).

## What's Left to Build (Roadmap from README)
- Filter by created time.
- Automatically download small objects to the computer.

## Known Issues
- None explicitly mentioned in the README, but further investigation might reveal some.

## Project Evolution/Decisions
- Focused on user-friendliness for non-technical users.
- Adopted Masonry layout for visual browsing.
- Implemented "Super Right-Click" for contextual actions.
- Added smart overwrite handling during uploads.
- Integrated a licensing system.
