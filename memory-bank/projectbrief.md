# Project Brief: R2Uploader

## Core Goal
Provide a user-friendly GUI desktop application to simplify the upload and management of Cloudflare R2 objects.

## Target Audience
Users, especially non-technical ones, who need an easier way to interact with Cloudflare R2 storage compared to command-line tools or the standard Cloudflare dashboard.

## Key Requirements
- Connect to Cloudflare R2 using Account ID and API Token.
- Securely store credentials locally.
- Browse R2 buckets and objects visually (Masonry layout preferred).
- Upload files/objects, preventing accidental overwrites with rename option.
- Manage objects: Delete, Export (for images), Copy Shareable Link (with custom domain support), Copy to Clipboard.
- Search objects by prefix.
- Navigate folder-like structures (using delimiters).
- Support for custom domains for public access/sharing.
- Automatic application updates.
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows).
